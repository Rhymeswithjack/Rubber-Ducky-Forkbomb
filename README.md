# Rubber-Ducky-Forkbomb
a basic rubber ducky fork bomb payload made for windows 10.

i do not take responsibility for whatever this code is used for.

A basic payload for a rubber ducky that creates a .bat file that when opened creates a fork bomb that eventually causes the target PC to use all the CPU forcing the PC to go to a BSOD, the target pc however will be fine after a restart

the base file will not automatically start the file however it will create and find the file. the code to automatically start the fork bomb file is left at the end of the code just remove the "REM" before the code to enable it
